## 15. Structuring the unstructured
Smartphones already include several sensors that can be used to improve the interaction with
the phone (e.g., answer calls), monitor the userâ€™s physical activity, and locate the user in
indoor spaces. The accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer are widely adopted to attain this goal. 
The sensory data is described as time series data since these data points are
captured in sequential time order. Over time, Fraunhofer AICOS collected several datasets and
saved a file for each sensor/user, which were stored in a network filesystem. These files are
accessed by our Data Scientists to apply Machine Learning (ML) technics and develop physical
activity and indoor location algorithms. AICOS developed a platform developed that consists of
a Spring Boot [1](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) enabled back-end server, providing a RESTful API; the data is stored on a
MongoDB [2](https://www.mongodb.com) database and Keycloak [3](https://www.keycloak.org) is adopted for authentication.
The objective of this application to migrate the datasets available in ASCII files to a NoSQL
databased through the provided API. We will deliver the datasets, a public instance of the
AICOS platform, and the API documentation
